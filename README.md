# Aurelia Quick Start
This branch is based on the [Aurelia Quick Start example](http://aurelia.io/hub.html#/doc/article/aurelia/framework/latest/quick-start).

To start the completed tutorial example use NodeJS to start up a simple web server in the project 
folder. First globally install the http-server command with 

```bash
npm install http-server -g
```

In some environments you may need to use sudo. Once that is installed, change directory to the 
project folder. You can now spin up the server from within the folder with the following command

```bash
http-server -o -c-1
```
 
 Navigate to http://localhost:8080/ in your browser to use/view the app.
