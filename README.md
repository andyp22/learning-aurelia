# Forms and Quizzes
This branch is just me playing with forms and quizzes in Aurelia.

 - To get [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io) working I used some very helpful advice found on 
[StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39271458/how-can-i-add-font-awesome-to-my-aurelia-project-using-npm).
 - I have also been using a tutorial over at [Scotch.io](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-mini-instagram-app-with-aurelia)
by Chris Nwamba for inspiration.
